My name is Jeffrey, and I am an engineer - with a focus on backend development and cloud native. I build technology for living, primarily working in Go. Outside of work, I like to play around with different technology for fun in my personal time mostly with Go or Rust - I got started with Rust recently, and I really like it.

This blog is going to be my learning journal or my mind journal. I will basically note down my learning process,and also my thought related to technology.
